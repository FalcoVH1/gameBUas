The file BUasDevelopmentLog.docx is a concise, clean version of the logs for the development process.
The file BUasDevelopmentLogPersonal.docx is a very lengthy, more informal version of the logs
for the development process, which I wrote partly for fun and partly because it's nice to have
logs of things you've worked on.

I don't expect the file BUasDevelopmentLogPersonal.docx to be read completely, as it's about ~80 pages, but it's very in detail and contains a lot of pictures,
code breakdowns, and details my personal experience while working on the game
